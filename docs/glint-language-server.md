The `glint-language-server` can be used by editor integrations to use Glint's typechecking features as you type:

The language server enables your editor to provide richer help, such as typechecking, type information on hover, automated refactoring, and more. See [the VS Code extension README](https://github.com/typed-ember/glint/tree/main/packages/vscode) for further examples.
